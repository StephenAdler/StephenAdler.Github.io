I"<p>I was born in Zhuhai, which is a lovely seaside town in Guangdong, China. I was raised in a family consisting of solely Hubei people, so I might as well be identified as a Hubeinese(rather than Cantonese).</p>

<p>I went to Beijing for college when I was 18, and spent 7 years at Peking University, where I got my BSc in Enviromental Science and MA in Economics. Currently I am a Econ PhD student at Penn State University.</p>
